I would highly recommend Chris to anyone looking to grow as an engineering leader!" – Kelsey Kernan (Strava)

I really appreciated how Chris would customize each session to address any new situations that came up since our last session at the same time as making progress on my long term goals." – Brian Chastain (One Main Financial)

"I feel lucky to have had Chris be my mentor/coach. I appreciated Chris’ patience and calm delivery. I also loved that he brought a genuine enthusiasm for everything we did each day. It is so like Chris to help others become their best professional selves.  I later went on to start my own web development company using all of the skills Chris taught me." – Kari Newhouse (Dachis Group)
